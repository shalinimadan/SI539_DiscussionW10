# SI539_DiscussionW10

You’ve been given the world’s worst form — a chaotic, inaccessible web form built with HTML and CSS.
Your mission is to fix it using your understanding of accessibility and coursework so far. You are required to comment out the syntax you will not be using.
**Note**: **Do not delete** or change the code; instead, **comment** out lines you will not be using. 

**Objectives**

By completing this exercise, you will learn to:

Identify accessibility problems in HTML and CSS

Use HTML comments (<!-- ... -->) and CSS comments (/* ... */) correctly

Replace poor code with accessible alternatives

Explain why your changes improve accessibility

**Instructions**
Open the project in your code editor. You will see two files:

index.html

style.css

Run the form in your browser and observe what makes it confusing, flashy, or difficult to use.

Comment out the inaccessible parts of the code.

Use <!-- ... --> in HTML

Use /* ... */ in CSS

Write your corrected, accessible version directly below the commented-out code.

Add a one-line explanation describing why your fix improves accessibility.
